When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I need collaborate with others in a project or just for safe keeping in case of my files get removed or my system redered 
unusable.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Since I Would be updating code on my lcoal repository if I let git autamatically update my remote repository 
it could render my code on remote useless because my could be in incomplete state so it is beter to update code manually.
