q1:What happens when you initialize a repository? why do you need to do it?
a1: After initializing a repository git will keep record of all my commits and I need to do it because otherwise it will be a mere folder
I will not be able to run git log on it.

Q2:How is staging area different from the working directory and the repository? what value do you think it offers?
A2: Staging area is where we add files to be committed when we do git commit.
Working directory is where I make actual changes to my files and repository is where commits are stored.

Q3:How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
A3:By using git diff and git diff --staged I can make sure of that.
